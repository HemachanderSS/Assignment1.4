1.Characteristics of Big data:
	*Volume:
		It denotes size of the data which determines the value and potential of the
data under consideration and whether it can actually be considered as Big Data or not.
	*Variety:
		It helps the people, who are closely analyzing the data and are associated
with it,to effectively use the data to their advantage and thus upholding the importance of 
the Bigdata.
	*Velocity:
		It refers to the speed of generation of data (i.e) how fast the particular 
data is generated and processed to meet the demands and the challenges which lie ahead in the path 
of growth and development.
	*variability:
		It refers to the inconsistency which can be shown by the data at times,thus
hampering the process of being able to handle and manage the data effectively.
	*Complexity:
		It is difficult to manage the data when it comes from various sources.Thus 
data need to be linked,connected and correlated in order to be able to grasp the information
that is supposed to be conveyed by these data.


2.Solutions to handle Big data:
   	The number of tools that have been developed to handle bigdata are
	*Hadoop
	*Spark
	*Oracle
	*Gfs
	

3.Difference between scale-out and scale-up:
	*Scale-up:
		When there is a shortage of resources in a particular system at that time adding
an additional resources to that system is called as scale up.
	*Scale-out:
		The process of splitting up the task with multiple system in order to increase
the peformance speed is called as scale out.
